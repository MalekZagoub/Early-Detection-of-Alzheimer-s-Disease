# Early-Detection-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease
The number of people affected by Alzheimer's Disease (AD) increases each year, but unfortunately, there is still no curative treatment for this neurodegenerative disease. However, early detection of AD at the stage of Moderate Cognitive Impairment (MCI) ensures proper patient care and allows for the development and testing of new treatments to slow the deterioration of cognitive abilities. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

As part of the PAQ-Collabora project, titled "Artificial Intelligence for Neurodegenerative and Cerebrovascular Diseases," we have chosen to focus on Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the medical and scientific aspects, our project has a significant social dimension. Alzheimer's disease affects not only patients but also their families and communities. Early and accurate diagnosis of this disease allows for appropriate care and improves the quality of life for patients and their families. Our goal is to develop an innovative tool for early and accurate diagnosis of the disease.

We aim to implement a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This model will detect whether the patient is at the beginning of the MCI stage or approaching the Alzheimer's stage
